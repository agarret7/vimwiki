# Goals

Last Wednesday my roommate had a mental health situation, which took the whole
day and required my full attention. It has now resolved, so I'll finish up the
tasks from last week.

This primarily means merging the metadata visualization branch into the
structure visualization branch (later, will merge PR for metadata vis, then
merge master into structure vis branch), and then using that code to generate
frequency annotations.

Afterwards, it will be worth generating several figures with the new
visualizations, which can be included as unit tests for the actual PR as well.


# Tasks

* [ ] Merge metadata visualization branch into structure visualization
* [ ] Frequency annotated below the structure visualization
* [ ] Verbose option that enables or disables words for graphviz
* [ ] Generate figures highlighting the visualization
