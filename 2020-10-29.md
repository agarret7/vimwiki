# Daily Context & Goals

Yesterday, added inference test for the simple dynamic scene with one object
being lowered onto another across 30 time steps.

Today, I want to duplicate the structure model test, to consider slack over
angles instead of 


# Prospective Tasks

* [X] Add dynamic orientation test.


# Daily Reflection

* Decided to work on some dynamic modeling to set us up for the first dynamic
  inference test.
* Visualization of true and approximated posterior.
* More explicitly documented the sensitivity of the posterior to changes in
  `sliding_xy_drift_length` and `floating_pos_drift_length`, with a plot.
