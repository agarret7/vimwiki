# Daily Context & Goals

Yesterday, added inference test for the simple dynamic scene with one object
being lowered onto another across 30 time steps.

Today, I want to duplicate the structure model test, to consider slack over
angles instead of 


# Prospective Tasks

* [X] Extend first simple inference test (single-frame, two objects, static
      structure) visualization by rendering true and approximated posterior
      together.
* [X] Add above test and visualization to document. Add generated plot.
* [X] Implement dynamic posterior unit test, with one object being lowered onto
      another across 30 time steps. This will be set-up for the first dynamic
      inference test.
* [X] Visualize posterior for the above test, under various settings of
      `sliding_xy_drift_length` and `floating_pos_drift_length`.
* [X] Add above test and visualization to document. Add generated plot.
* [X] Fix some bugs in the implementation of structure sampling
* [X] PR review for Ben's "default" view semantics


# Daily Reflection

* Decided to work on some dynamic modeling to set us up for the first dynamic
  inference test.
* Visualization of true and approximated posterior.
* More explicitly documented the sensitivity of the posterior to changes in
  `sliding_xy_drift_length` and `floating_pos_drift_length`, with a plot.
