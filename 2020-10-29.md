# Daily Context & Goals

Yesterday, added inference test for the simple dynamic scene with one object
being lowered onto another across 30 time steps.

Today, I want to duplicate the structure model test, to consider slack over
angles instead of positions


# Prospective Tasks

* [X] Add dynamic orientation test
