# Daily Goals

[Yesterday](2020-09-02.md) I resumed work by updating the status of the PR and issue,
addressed outstanding code reviews, implemented a utility function for saving videos,
and began work on multi-particle visualization.

I believe I can complete [(3.6)](OverlaySceneGraphOnCameraImage.md#Deliverables) by the end of today. That would leave Friday open
for digesting deliverables into forms that can be easily understood by the team.

Making the vimwiki shareable is taking slightly higher priority, since I want
to resume doing lab standups effectively and get feedback from Rachel/Vikash.
If not completed by the end of the week, I'll do it this weekend.

# Prospective Tasks

* [X] Multi-particle visualization [(3.6)](OverlaySceneGraphOnCameraImage.md#Deliverables)
    * [X] Visually verify the quality of the perturbed beliefs in the test scene
    * [X] Write unit test for aggregated beliefs
    * [X] Implement `overlayAggregatedSceneGraphs`
        * [X] Set aggregated object positions to be average over positions of objects in the scene
        * [X] Implement `averageQuat` following [this](https://github.com/christophhagen/averaging-quaternions/blob/master/averageQuaternions.py)
        * [X] Set aggregated objects orientations to be `averageQuat` applied to each object in the scene.
        * [X] Implement `_countUndirectedStructures(gs::Vector{<:AbstractGraph})`
              (factorized to use with multi-particle GViz, when we get to
              that part of the integration).
        * [X] Set aggregated edges to be those of the most common undirected structure.
        * [X] Render aggregated scene graph using `overlaySceneGraph`
* [X] Add object "whitelist" for `overlaySceneGraph` that toggles rendering
      certain objects in the scene ([link](https://probcomp.slack.com/archives/CJWB46MME/p1597755372080200) to thread that inspired this).
* [.] Upload vimwiki to share with others
    * [X] Change vimwiki syntax to markdown
    * [ ] Set up a static webpage with Hugo/GitHub pages
    * [ ] Upload vimwiki to private GitHub pages
    * [ ] Create CRON job to automatically pull, commit, and push periodically

# Daily Reflection

* Tomorrow I can begin work on digesting deliverables for the team. I can knock
  out two birds with one stone by embedding them in Jupyter notebooks, which
  will improve my workflow, and allow me to feel out what the
  [tutorials](SceneGraphInferenceTutorialSequence.md) will look like.
* I've been systematically underestimating the detail contained in
  `overlayAggregatedSceneGraphs`. I have the documentation for it now, but it
  was underspecified as a task. For the weekly review, good to think about
  how/where to include documentation for proposed pieces of software (probably
  just the GH issue).
* `S.setContact!` and `S.setPose!` currently do not delete edges, which makes
  it really annoying to change from floating to sliding structures easily. In
  general I think I want to make an issue detailing some ways to increase
  support for graph modification operations (instead of graph construction
  operations), since we often want to make slight perturbations to graphs
  without having to copy everything.
* Second day that I didn't get to vimwiki after putting it in my todo. It
  really is something better reserved for the weekend, like Saturday.
