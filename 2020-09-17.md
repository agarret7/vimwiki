# Prospective Tasks

* [X] Setup GenSceneGraphs dependency
    * [X] Configure local project and container (with Ben)
    * [X] Literally just use the script that already exists for running Julia
          in the container (unblocking me on refactor effort ðŸ˜Š)
* [X] Address latest round of Ben's review for the integration [PR](https://github.com/probcomp/GenSceneGraphs.jl/pull/188)
* [ ] Finish [refactor deliverable (1.1 - datagen)](RefactorDerenderingUsingGenSceneGraphs.md#Deliverables)
    * [ ] Convert YCB-Synthetic to modified format
        * [ ] Refactor raw YCB-Synthetic generation to produce content in modified format
        * [ ] Test generation on 10 scenes
* [ ] Finish [refactor deliverable (1.2 - data download)](RefactorDerenderingUsingGenSceneGraphs.md#Deliverables)
    * [ ] [refactor deliverable (1.2.3 - ycb-synthetic data download)](RefactorDerenderingUsingGenSceneGraphs.md#Deliverables)
        * [ ] Upload 10 scenes to S3 bucket as temporary placeholder for more data
* [ ] Commit, push, and ping Nishad

# Daily Reflection

* "Last rounds" of the PR review is taking much longer than I expected, I spent
  most of today working on fixing errors on test cases that I had missed
  (wasn't running the entire test suite when I pushed to the PR).
