# Daily Context & Goals

Nishad is blocked on the [refactor](RefactorDerenderingUsingGenSceneGraphs.md)


# Prospective Tasks

* [X] Make PR for model refactor into master branch of GenSceneDerender, and
      request Nishad's review on modeling code
* [X] Implement [GenSceneGraphs#216](https://github.com/probcomp/GenSceneGraphs.jl/issues/216)
* [X] Address Ben's latest PR review for [GenSceneGraphs#225](https://github.com/probcomp/GenSceneGraphs.jl/pull/225)
* [ ] Clean up `run_methods.jl` refactor 
* [ ] Begin refactor of `inference.jl`


# Daily Reflection

* Shorter plans are actually often better, and more useful. Most important part
  is connecting to the higher level goal, and having them be clear enough to
  start taking action. Not specifying in excruciating detail what I need to do
  to finish the task, because those plans almost always break. Excessive
  detail actually serves as noise that distracts from the ultimate purpose of
  these tasks.
* Finished up these tasks on Saturday.
* On Sunday I will complete a design doc for the first iteration of the
  tutorial sequence.
