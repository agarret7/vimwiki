# Daily Context & Goals

Nishad is blocked on the [refactor](RefactorDerenderingUsingGenSceneGraphs.md) of the integration, so that will be my priority
until it's finished.


# Prospective Tasks

* [X] Address PR review from Nishad for GenSceneDerender on model refactor.
* [X] Merge PR for model refactor.
* [X] Begin refactor of `inference.jl`
* [X] Clean up `run_methods.jl`


# Daily Reflection

* Actually got to finish the inference refactor (almost certainly with runtime
  bugs). But it is in a running state.
* Was able to also clean up `run_methods.jl` a bit, although it's not quite
  done.
* Tomorrow I can work on getting baselines working properly, and address Ben's
  latest round of PR review.
