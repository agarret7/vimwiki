# Questions

* Can you tell me the name of the company, or stealth mode?

* From your description, big demo is acceleration of convolutional neural network
  on CPUs, that competes with GPU performance.
 
* What are the general responsibilities and requirements of the job?

* Is there any interest or exploration into acceleration of probabilistic
  computing primitives, or is it leaning heavily into acceleration of
  tensor-based computation?

* Who would I be working closely with? What's their background?


# Companies

## Neural Magic
* Sommerville 2017 5 million preseed 2019 15 million seed round led by Comcast
* Few PhD students mapping out neural connections in the brain, and frustrated
  by specialized hardware for deep learning
* Enable neural networks to run at faster speeds
