# What I (actually) did

* Finished the bulk of the PR review process for the integration.
* Started the refactor.
* Met with Nishad and began on-boarding him.


# What was good

* Recovery at end of the week was solid, was able to get a productive day on
  Friday.


# What could be improved

* Consistency in planning was weaker, partially because of a host of
  distractions during the middle of the week (like moving my workstation), but
  also because I was expressing some classic avoidance behavior. My plans were
  dependent on Ben, and I didn't check with him to get a proper estimate of how
  long he'd take to finish the PR review.
* I have had real problems with keeping with the stand-ups, and using the SCRUM
  table. I should
* Better reference to larger-scale goals at the beginning of the week, but
* Losing track of which parts of the workflow are essential, which is a classic
  sign of overstructuring and/or underdocumenting. I still think these practices
  are good, but I cannot remember all of the structure
  Next week, I will revise
  [Notebook](Notebook.md) with much more explicit and clear guidelines on what
  I should be doing every day in my workflow.

# Next Steps

## Specific

* Next week I will wrap up the PR with Ben, and merge the 
* Afterwards I should focus on the refactor and try to knock it out by the end
  of the week.
* I should plan to talk with Nishad early in the week to go over the code,
  potentially _during_ the refactor, in order to get his feedback on the
  interpretability of the model/inference code.

## Broader

* I need to take a step back and focus on simplicity/specificity in the
  workflow, so that I don't get overwhelmed by the number of things I need to
  do. Next week I should focus on being very clear on what my workflow is (in
  the morning and afternoon), and how I deal with early-morning disruptions
  (like starting the day late) without losing productivity.
