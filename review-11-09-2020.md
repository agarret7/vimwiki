# What I (actually) did

* Finished the bulk of the PR review process for the integration.
* Started the refactor.
* Met with Nishad and began on-boarding him about overall project status.
* Did not finish the PR, like I wanted to.
* Did not on-board Nishad with model structure (I didn't make a plan for
  meeting with him!)


# What was good

* Recovery at end of the week was solid, was able to get a productive day on
  Friday, while ignoring most distractions.
* I wrote down that I was distracted _3/4_ of the days, which is helping me to
  see I need to be better about guarding my attention from external distractions.


# What could be improved

* I mentioned many times that I was distracted:
    * Half of this is because I was expressing some classic avoidance behavior.
      My plans were dependent on Ben, and I didn't check with him to get a
      proper estimate of how long he'd take to finish the PR review. The
      uncertainty meant my plans felt weak, I was unsure of how to proceed, and
      I did not think to update the plans when they conflicted with Ben's
      schedule.
    * The other half is because I moved rooms with two other people (my brother
      and his employee) who are *very* distractable and talk a lot. I cannot
      see myself reasonably convincing them to talk less (it's their office),
      so I'll have to focus on better ways to guard my own attention with the
      presence of other distractions.
* I have had real problems with keeping with the stand-ups, and using the SCRUM
  table. I should include these as an explicit part of my workflow.
* I'm losing track of which parts of the workflow are essential, and being a
  bit spotty on parts of the process like time-tracking and daily reviews,
  which is a classic sign of overstructuring and/or underdocumenting. I will
  first make an effort to revise [Notebook](Notebook.md) with much more explicit and clear
  guidelines on my daily workflow, and if that fails I will step back some
  of the structure in order to simplify and soldify the basics.


# Next Steps

## Specific

* Next week I will wrap up the PR with Ben.
* Afterwards I will focus on the refactor and try to knock it out by the end of
  the week.
* I should plan to talk with Nishad early in the week to go over the code,
  potentially _during_ the refactor, in order to get his feedback on the
  interpretability of the model/inference code.

## Broader

* I need to take a step back and focus on simplicity/specificity in the
  workflow, so that I don't get overwhelmed by the number of things I need to
  do. Next week I should focus on being very clear on what my workflow is (in
  the morning and afternoon), and how I deal with early-morning disruptions
  (like starting the day late) without losing productivity.
* To keep from getting overwhelmed with an excessive number of things to "keep
  in mind", I'm *just* giving myself the goal of writing down my workflow next
  week, so that I don't
