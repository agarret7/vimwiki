# Weekly Context

* Refactor is proceeding rather well, after we got past the major refactors
  spawned by the model code.


# Goals
* [ ] Respond to PR review by Ben on the metadata vis, and structure sampling code
* [ ] Finish last task with model refactor (converting Hopf parameterization to
      6DoF slack)
* [ ] Finish the [refactor](RefactorDerenderingUsingGenSceneGraphs.md)
* [ ] Meet with Ben, Marco, (Viksah?) to discuss ROS refactor
* [ ] Help Nishad to get caught up on scene graph inference current state, so
      he can begin inference debugging.
