# Daily Context & Goals

Today I'll finish the unit test refactoring, and will work on coming up with an
actual set of unit tests for the design doc.


# Prospective Tasks

* [ ] Write down basic docstring for each unit test. Copy static link to google
      doc, with short headline describing the high-level summary of the test's
      objectives
* [ ] Review existing unit tests, refactor with infrastructure and rename variables
      to be more precise.
    * [ ] Fix infrastructure if unable to recovered original test results.
* [ ] Draw picture for each unit test. Upload to Google Drive, and add static
      link to docstring.
* [ ] Add additional unit tests design:
    * [ ] Posterior over sliding structure, sweeping over slack, w/ latents ==
          observations
    * [ ] Sequence of frames with outliers, visualizing the posterior
    * [ ] Sequence of frames going from floating -> sliding -> floating,
          visualizing
