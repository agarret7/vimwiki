* Really allow myself to be mentored by Nishad as much as possible
* Nishad has followed a trajectory that may be similar to what I did
* Nishad might have experience in geometric computations
* Nishad can take the long view and intrinsically motivated by the paper, would
  be good for the project.
* Focus on demos and benchmarking infrastructure, and explaining to him what's
  needed so that we can all work on debugging modeling and inference. To do
  that, we need all the demos and quantitative results from the full pipeline,
  fully reproducible.
