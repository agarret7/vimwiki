* Really allow myself to be mentored by Nishad as much as possible
* Nishad has followed a trajectory that may be similar to what I did
* Nishad might have experience in geometric computations
* Nishad can take the long view and intrinsically motivated by the paper, would
  be good for the project.
* Focus on demos and benchmarking infrastructure, and explaining to him what's
  needed so that we can all work on debugging modeling and inference. To do
  that, we need all the demos and quantitative results from the full pipeline,
  fully reproducible.
* After refactoring and before tutorials, first spend a day or two writing a
  design doc.
* First part of next week for design doc, and end of the week would be the
  first stab at the implementation. Vikash will review design doc Tuesday
  afternoon.
* Goal by Friday the 18th have the refactor shipped.
* Goal by Friday the 25th have the first draft of the tutorials.
* Few days the week after the tutorial for the benchmark.
* Document what you mean "aggregate" in `overlayAggregatedSceneGraphs`.
* Spend half-an-hour doing X to timebox planning.
* Sub-milestones and accountability on deliverables.


1. Clone a repo
2. Read the README.md
3. Run make and as output
4. What is the minimal table/figure that Nishad can give me feedback on.
