# Daily Context & Goals

Work on the [refactor](RefactorDerenderingUsingGenSceneGraphs.md).

# Prospective Tasks

* [X] Work on [refactor deliverable (1.1)](RefactorDerenderingUsingGenSceneGraphs.md#Deliverables)
    * [X] Check code/format for YCB-Video to see if it's correct
    * [X] Research ways to download subsequences of YCB-Video
    * [X] Test conversion script on 2 sequences
* [ ] Convert YCB-Synthetic to modified format
    * [ ] Refactor raw YCB-Synthetic generation to produce content in modified format
    * [ ] Test generation on 10 scenes
* [o] Work on [refactor deliverable (1.2)](RefactorDerenderingUsingGenSceneGraphs.md#Deliverables)
    * [X] Convert YCB-InHouse to modified format
        * [X] Write conversion script
        * [X] Convert each folder using conversion script
        * [X] Upload new compressed dataset to S3 bucket
        * [X] Test download of new dataset
    * [ ] [refactor deliverable (1.2.3)](RefactorDerenderingUsingGenSceneGraphs.md#Deliverables)
        * [ ] Upload 10 scenes to S3 bucket as temporary placeholder for more data
* [ ] Commit, push, and ping Nishad

# Daily Reflection

* I have a tendency to externalize the source of my inaction, and feel like I
  am solving the problem by thinking really hard about what I need to do,
  instead of doing it. The processes I've set up are sufficient, I do not need
  to write more about what I'm doing. I need to pay much more attention to when
  I am and am not acting on goals, and if I am not acting on a goal, assume
  that I can do something about it UNTIL proven wrong by a concrete obstacle.
  Crucially, I am not blocked by my process at this moment.
* That being said, I'm actually somewhat blocked/need help from Ben on setting
  up the GenSceneGraphs dependency. I was waiting for the [`container_ctl` PR](https://github.com/probcomp/GenSceneGraphs.jl/pull/205)
  for GenSceneGraphs.jl to be integrated (provides functionality for a proper
  project workflow), but I realized since it only supports the Jupyter notebook
  workflow it won't work with the Makefile anyway, so tomorrow I will ping Ben directly.
* Tomorrow once I get the dependency set up I will be unblocked on the meat of the
  integration. It shouldn't take more than an hour to set up once I get Ben's feedback.
