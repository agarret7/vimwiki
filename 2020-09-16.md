# Daily Reflection

* I have a tendency to externalize the source of my inaction, and feel like I
  am solving the problem by thinking really hard about what I need to do,
  instead of doing it. The processes I've set up are sufficient, I do not need
  to write more about what I'm doing. I need to pay much more attention to when
  I am and am not acting on goals, and if I am not acting on a goal, assume
  that I can do something about it UNTIL proven wrong by a concrete obstacle.
  Crucially, I am not blocked by my process at this moment.
