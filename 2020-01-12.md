# Goals

3.2 Examples

3.2.1 Point-Estimate Beliefs

FIGURE: Single synthetic scene, like that used in the unit tests for
        visualizations, with multiple objects resting on a table. Contacts are clearly
        visualized, and objects are colored appropriately.

3.2.2 Distributions over Structure Beliefs

FIGURE: Visualizing the structure from the previous scene

3.2.3 Distributions over Scene Beliefs

FIGURE: _left_: collage of 9 particles visualized using the above inference
        _right: aggregated particle beliefs, composited with distribution visualization
        
*** TAKE A BREAK ***

3.2.4 Visualizing RJMCMC Structure Inference

FIGURE: 4 frames vertically stacked with metadata visualized
