# Daily Context & Goals

I will spend 1 hour today downscoping the [refactor](RefactorDerenderingUsingGenSceneGraphs.md), and writing a new goal
for unit testing. Afterwards, I will clean up the remainder of the refactor


# Prospective Tasks

* [ ] Implement basic unit tests for model
    * [ ] Single object, static scene, gridding GaussianVMF
    * [ ] Two objects, static scene, moving latent and observation together and
          seeing posterior probability on structure.
* [ ] Continue adding unit tests to [design doc for unit tests](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Du0mzktc_ihv8I0TlRyG8IrvkqOUpSGNev446GOJCSQ/edit#heading=h.oh5qaafnr88q)
* [ ] Specify new goal: unit testing GenSceneDerender


# Daily Reflection

* Didn't quite get to unit testing, but that's OK. We'll work on that tomorrow,
  as the main task to do during the day.
