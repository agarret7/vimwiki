# Daily Context & Goals

I will spend 30 minutes today clarifying the [refactor](RefactorDerenderingUsingGenSceneGraphs.md), and writing a new goal
for unit testing. Per Ben's suggestion, I'll downscope to something I can
finish today, and put the rest in a backlog issue.

That should leave just enough room at the end of the day to add the first two
unit tests, respond to Vikash's comments on the design doc, and continue
fleshing that out to something more substantial.


# Prospective Tasks

* [X] Refine [refactor](RefactorDerenderingUsingGenSceneGraphs.md) goal (15 minutes)
* [X] Fix edge heuristic baseline
* [X] Verify all baselines working with `run_methods.jl`
* [X] Verify all evaluation working with `run_evaluation.jl`
* [X] `run_methods.jl` for inference (sample from prior to test)
* [ ] Fix ycb-pcg pose inaccuracies (verified by `overlaySceneGraph` matching `dope.avi`)
* [ ] Documentation of the remaining `Makefile` recipes
* [ ] Ping Nishad to test remaining refactor
* [ ] Implement basic unit tests for model
    * [ ] Single object, static scene, gridding GaussianVMF
    * [ ] Two objects, static scene, moving latent and observation together and
          seeing posterior probability on structure
* [ ] Respond to Vikash's comments on unit test design doc
* [ ] Continue adding unit tests to [design doc for unit tests](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Du0mzktc_ihv8I0TlRyG8IrvkqOUpSGNev446GOJCSQ/edit#heading=h.oh5qaafnr88q)
* [ ] Specify new goal: unit testing GenSceneDerender (15 minutes)


# Daily Reflection

* Didn't quite get to unit testing, but that's OK. We'll work on that tomorrow,
  as the main task to do during the day.
