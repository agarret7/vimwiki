# Introduction

# Bayesian Approaches to Computer Vision

# Symbolic Programming for Bayesian Inference

Using existential doubt as a working example, we demonstrate the capacity of
symbolic generative models to represent integrate common-sense knowledge into
predictive systems.

# Intractibility of Rich Likelihoods

We demonstrate that the likelihood landscape generated by the robust rendering
likelihood contains many local minima, and how this leads to intractability
concerns of when using uninformed MCMC proposals. This motivates the
development of a new model, based instead on an error-corrective approach that
seeks to integrate common-sense information
