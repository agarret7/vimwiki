Applications of Probabilistic Programming to Predictive Vision

What is the story?

We started with existential doubt, running simple MCMC chains on a generative
model containing an in-the-loop renderer. We demonstrated how this

# Symbolic Programming for Bayesian Inference

Using existential doubt as a working example, we demonstrate the capacity of
symbolic generative models to integrate common-sense knowledge into predictive
systems.

# Intractibility of Rich Likelihoods

We demonstrate that the likelihood landscape generated by the robust rendering
likelihood contains many local minima, and how this leads to intractability
concerns of when using uninformed MCMC proposals.

This motivates the
development of a new neuro-symbolic model, based instead on an error-corrective
approach, that seeks to model the outputs of a neural detector as noisy
measurements of a latent abstract scene representation called a scene graph.

# Scene Graphs as Scene Representations

* Why do we need scene graph representations?
* Objects and geometric relationships

# Modeling
* Scene graph prior
* Dynamics
    * Parameters
    * Structure

# Inference
* Reversible jump MCMC for structure moves
* Data-driven proposals for floating and sliding parameters
* Gaussian kernels for pose refinement
