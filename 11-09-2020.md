# Daily Goals

Finally have some space to think (no morning meetings, no workspace issues,
just came into the office in the morning).

Ben completed his review of my PR, and requested a review of his own separate
PR. I'm going to start small today, focus on those PR reviews so we can
actually wrap up the merge request (the refactor is blocked on Ben's PR anyway,
so I'd have to do that beforehand).

I should include a specific task to replan
in the middle of the day if the PR reviews are shorter than expected

# Prospective Tasks

* [ ] Austin's PR reviews
    * [ ] Pull and merge master into working branch
    * [ ] Address and fix Ben's comments
* [ ] Ben's PR reviews
