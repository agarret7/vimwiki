# Daily Goals

Main goals for today are working on the tail end of the [first part](OverlaySceneGraphOnCameraImage.md) of the
integration efforts. Ben is on vacation for the rest of the week, so it would
be good to batch up all new work for the [PR](https://github.com/probcomp/GenSceneGraphs.jl/pull/188) to be completed before he returns.
The main tasks that remain are [integration deliverables (3.5, 3.6)](OverlaySceneGraphOnCameraImage.md#Deliverables), which are
generating videos, and multi-particle visualization, which I believe can be completed
in the rest of the week. Completing these things before Ben returns will allow
for a tight iterative review of the work, and hopefully lead to completing
[Overlay SceneGraph on Camera Image](OverlaySceneGraphOnCameraImage.md) by the middle of next week.

A secondary goal (something to be completed in spare time, probably after
work), is continuing to set up my workflow in vimwiki so I can easily share my
[Notebook](Notebook.md) and [Goals](Goals.md) with other people for feedback. I have to be careful
not to spend _too_ much time on optimizing workflow or it will become
increasingly brittle, and eventually fail to serve its purpose of being a
useful structure for work.

Making the vimwiki shareable is taking slightly higher priority, since I want
to resume doing lab standups effectively. If not completed by the end of the
week, I'll do it this weekend.

# Prospective Tasks

* [X] Resolve latest batch of [PR reviews](https://github.com/probcomp/GenSceneGraphs.jl/pull/188) for the [integration](OverlaySceneGraphOnCameraImage.md)
    * [X] Merge latest master branch into the working branch
    * [X] Go through and respond to each conversation in the PR
    * [X] Push latest work to the working branch
* [X] Update [issue](https://github.com/probcomp/GenSceneGraphs.jl/issues/183) for the [integration](OverlaySceneGraphOnCameraImage.md) with latest interface spec
    * [X] Rename/simplify title for consistent naming
    * [X] Update external-facing interface to be consistent with working branch
* [X] Extending visualization: [integration deliverables (3.5, 3.6)](OverlaySceneGraphOnCameraImage.md#Deliverables)
    * [X] Implement video function as described in the newly-updated [issue](https://github.com/probcomp/GenSceneGraphs.jl/issues/183)
    * [X] Start implementing multi-particle visualization functionality as described in the newly-updated [issue](https://github.com/probcomp/GenSceneGraphs.jl/issues/183)
        * [X] Write a doc string describing the functionality of `overlayAggregatedSceneGraphs`
        * [X] Construct a test scene with 10 different beliefs where each
              object is randomly perturbed from the ground truth pose, and 6 of
              the scene graphs lack an edge between the table and one of the
              objects (to test contact graph aggregation).
* [ ] Upload vimwiki to share with others
    * [ ] Upload vimwiki to private GitHub pages
    * [ ] Create CRON job to automatically pull, commit, and push periodically

# Daily Reflection

* Successfully used new vimwiki setup, and found it exceptionally easy to use,
  and useful for linking between higher-level goals and daily actions.
* "Start implementing multi-particle functionality" was a bit too vague to be
  useful, so I expanded to a few more subtasks.
* Tomorrow should be almost entirely focused on finishing up the multi-particle
  rendering functionality, and potentially some other minor improvements to the
  visualization interface (like allowing blacklisting certain objects to
  exclude them from the rendered wireframe overlay).
