# Goals

Continue to work on visualization extensions.


# Tasks

* [o] Function taking in a list of scene graphs, and returns a rendered visualization of the structure distribution:
    * [X] Calculates structure frequency
    * [X] Renders the top k most frequent structures
    * [X] Composites them horizontally
    * [ ] frequency annotated below the structure
* [X] Optional borders for `createCollage`
* [X] Merge master into metadata vis branch


# Reflection

* Didn't quite finish the PR, since rendering the structure distirbution relies
  on metadata visualization to annotate structure probabilities underneath the
  graphviz entities.
* Tomorrow I can finish that up, and generate figures, if I manage my time
  well.
