Incredible machine


Motivation:
Bringing neuro-symbolic computation to something more concrete

Problem:
Solve Incredible Machine, which requires a decent understanding of physics
Non-markovian structure

Process:
Wrap the game up in a nice gym-like API
Worse than any type of game in terms of sample complexity

Solution:
First component is a derenderer
ADEPT-like derenderer

Mayflower project - automatic shipping from US to UK
Lots of sensor data, and want to create a predictive model of navigation in the water
Where a derenderer is really helpful, is finding where an object is


Contrastive learning
You can take an image, apply two random transforms, minimize the contrastive
difference in the latent space.

SimClear may be what an generative model
Big BiGan gets to lower

If you just train a classifier and then use the last layer of
