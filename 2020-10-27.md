# Daily Context & Goals

Continue working on [Unit Testing](GenSceneDerenderUnitTesting.md) for scene graph inference.


# Prospective Tasks

* [X] Extend first simple inference test (single-frame, two objects, static
      structure) visualization by rendering true and approximated posterior
      together.
* [X] Implement dynamic posterior unit test, with one object being lowered onto
      another across 30 time steps. This will be set-up for the first dynamic
      inference test.
* [X] Visualize posterior for the above test
* [X] Fix some bugs in the implementation of structure sampling
* [ ] PR review for Ben's "default" view semantics


# Daily Reflection

* Decided to work on some dynamic modeling to set us up for the first dynamic
  inference test.
