# Daily Context & Goals

We're proceeding with unit testing the model (visualizing and checking the
posterior). What would be a good "done" condition for this?

Meeting with Vikash today to talk about unit testing.


# Prospective Tasks

* [ ] Visualize prior samples using GenSceneGraphs
* [ ] Set up physically plausible multi-frame scene
* [ ] Switch the slack offset vs logpdf at latents == observations to visualize
      the posterior

# Daily Reflection

* Visualize structure posterior in the various tests.
* Visualizing the slack in the metadata visualization.
* Check Nishad's test on outliers (potentially extend it?)
* Visualize posterior samples
* Set up physically plausible multi-frame scene, and visualize crucial aspects
  like the structure posterior
* Switch the slack offset vs logpdf at latents == observations to visualize
  the posterior
