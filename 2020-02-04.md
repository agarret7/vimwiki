The company:
* About 200 people, R&D, spanning from the most basic research,
  and are very much basic research problems
* All the way to transition of products to operational products,
  or commercial development of projects.
* Most work for DoD
* Medical, environmental, and humanitarian thrust extending
* Very strong in AI/human-centered computing. Combine those two to
  make systems that work well for people
* Kind of like a university department, but with a little more of a
  tool/product focus that can be used by people. Extremely collegial,
  but with the funding to do larger research projects.
* Avi is a PL guy and focused on PPL, and computational ecology
* Brain is an AI guy from "way back", over 30 years. Integrative cognitive
  architectures, sensing, robotics systems, little bit of PPL, ran research
  groups.

# Projects
## COLTRANE
* Assuming we know how to "function" in a particular environment
* Play Monopoly, the other is minecraft
* Someone introduces novel phenomenon into the system, detect the novelty,
  characterize it (how has the system changed), and then tie that into the
  planning.
* We have a probabilistic model of the domain, program synthesis task.
* We've discovered that Illinois Ave. is 2X the price, how general is the scope
  of the novelty?

## Human-centric (Psy-Coach?)
* PPL version for cognitive modeling, that interacts with humans
* Models of team interaction developed by a psychologist
* Can we build models that infers dynamics of the team

## SCRUF
* Based on predictive coding
* Interact with the world based on hierarchies of probabilistic modeling
* Middleware framework
* Planning system that is projecting the futures

## Talk to Broader Research Team
* Bell Lab
