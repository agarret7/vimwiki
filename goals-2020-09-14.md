# Weekly Context

* [Integration PR](OverlaySceneGraphOnCameraImage.md) is approaching its last few iterations,
  so we can proceed with the refactor while waiting on the merge.
* We're about to really get into the specification of the tutorial sequence, so
  keeping the refactor time-boxed to this week is quite important.
* Meeting with Vikash on Monday to talk about ways to collaborate with Nishad
  and the broader Cora team.


# Goals
* [ ] Finish PR reviews and marge [Overlay SceneGraphs on Camera Image](OverlaySceneGraphOnCameraImage.md)
* [ ] Finish the [refactor](RefactorDerenderingUsingGenSceneGraphs.md)
* [ ] Meet with Nishad to walk through Scene Graph modeling and inference code
