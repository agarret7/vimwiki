# Abstract motivation

At the highest level, the notebook serves as a bridge between bottom-up process
and top-down planning and goals. Each direction of information flow is
important:
1) Top -> Bottom: Allows useful top-down structuring of activities by
   formulating daily activities in reference to abstract goals. If the plans
   and goals are well-made, entries will likely heavily reference them, with
   small amounts of additional unpredicted information.
2) Bottom -> Top: Provides feedback on the planning and goals. If the plans and
   goals are poorly-made, entries may reference them only abstractly, and
   require large amounts of additional information to talk about unexpected
   challenges.

## Weekly Goals



## Daily Plans


Good prospective questions at the beginning of the day are:
    * What are my goals for today? How do they fit into the plan for the
      week/month? How do they advance towards my next milestone?
    * What are my plans for achieving my goals, in writing?
    * How do these plans hold up, when I read them back to myself? Do I believe
      the assumptions? How can they be debugged, clarified, or improved?

Good reflective questions at the end of the day are:
    * What happened today? (Results, examples, error messages, are great)
    * How does it advance my goals along the plan for the
      week/month/milestone/check-in?
    * What should my colleagues and advisor know about the work?
    * What help do I need or might I need?
    * What should I work on tomorrow?

## Reviews

Each week contains a review of activities during the week. It focuses on where
completed work diverged from plans, and suggestions for improvements on the
next iteration of plans. Part of the review process is updating [Goals](Goals.md), by
linking deliverables from the week that document progress at a higher level.

This is also a great place to consider if issues that popped up were specific
to the formulation of the goal, or if they derived from deeper issues that are
structurally neglected by this wiki.
