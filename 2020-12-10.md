# Daily Context

"""
* Tomorrow will work on scoping out figures with more detail, and writing out
  the plan for making each figure, as well as a scope of work if anything extra
  needs to be implemented in the Cora repository.
* Will also develop a brief plan for wrapping up remaining pull requests, and
  assisting Nishad with implementing final bits to put in the thesis.
"""


# Prospective Tasks
* [ ] Scope out figures for main thesis
* [X] Develop plan for wrapping up remaining pull requests


# Daily Reflection

* Plan for wrapping up pull requests:
    * Coordinate with Ben to check availability next week
    * Assuming Ben's availibility, few rounds of review next week on:
      [structure sampling](https://github.com/probcomp/GenSceneGraphs.jl/pull/225), [metadata vis](https://github.com/probcomp/GenSceneGraphs.jl/pull/226).
* Additional work for figures:
    * Check out Ben's work on diagnostic plots (hopefully is sufficient to
      composite different figures in a simple way).
    * Visualization of distributions over graph structures (~1 day of work)
* Final work with Nishad:
    * (For section 4.6) Quantitative evalutaion of models via marginal likelihood.

* Have figures and captions completed by Monday the 21st
