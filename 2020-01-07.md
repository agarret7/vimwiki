# Goals

Visualize and annotate new dataset.


# Prospective Tasks

Do the following for ycb-probcomp-static/0001 first:
* [o] Collect data
    * [X] Run nVidia DOPE on experiments
    * [ ] Visualize neural detections
* [ ] Add final data
    * [ ] Run plane detector on first depth frame; add to dope.json.
    * [ ] Annotate per-frame, per-object pose outlier status. Output as dope_annotation.json
    * [ ] Manually code scene graph structure in Julia
    * [ ] Set poses to average of inlier observed poses
    * [ ] Serialize "ground truth scenegraph" to gt_scenegraphs.json
* [ ] Verify quality
    * [ ] Add metadata visualization 
    * [ ] Visualize ground truth pose overlaid on first video frame. Save as gt_scenegraph.png
