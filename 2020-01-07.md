# Goals

Visualize and annotate new dataset.


# Prospective Tasks

Do the following for ycb-probcomp-static/0001 first:
* [X] Collect data
    * [X] Run nVidia DOPE on experiments
    * [X] Visualize neural detections
* [X] Add final data
    * [X] Manually add plane detections
    * [X] Annotate per-frame, per-object pose outlier status. Output as dope_annotation.json
    * [X] Manually code scene graph structure in Julia
    * [X] Set poses to average of inlier observed poses
    * [X] Serialize "ground truth scenegraph" to gt_scenegraphs.json
* [X] Verify quality
    * [X] Visualize ground truth pose overlaid on first video frame. Save as gt_scenegraph.png
