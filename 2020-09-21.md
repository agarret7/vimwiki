# Daily Context & Goals

The refactor is blocked on a modeling incompatibility with the GenSceneGraphs
repo. Instead of using 6DoF poses to parameterize slack like in the `master`
branch, Marco and I created a new branch and started using `:slack_z` (single
real-valued scalar) and `:slack_angle` (3D unit vector). This branch is
significantly out of date, and it's unclear if we want to continue to use this
parameterization going forward. Ben has requested a docstring specifying what
exactly the new parameterization is, so he can give a more thoughtful review.
Since the actual code changes were rather small, I suggested it would be easy for me 
to create a new branch from the latest `master` branch, and change the relevant
files, while adding a docstring so he can consider the pros and cons of the new
parameterization without blocking the refactor efforts.

After that, I will work on the [refactor](RefactorDerenderingUsingGenSceneGraphs.md).

# Prospective Tasks

* [ ] Create new branch on GenSceneGraphs with new slack parameterization
* [X] Make docker script that is more sane with our project structure
* [.] Finish [refactor deliverable (1.3 - model refactor)](RefactorDerenderingUsingGenSceneGraphs.md#Deliverables)
    * [X] Copy over the model
    * [ ] Refactor `run_methods.jl` to use new visualization, and generally
          clean up the file/add docstrings where relevant.
* [ ] Work on [refactor deliverable (1.4 - `run_methods.jl`)](RefactorDerenderingUsingGenSceneGraphs.md#Deliverables)
    * [ ] Copy over additional baseline heuristics, attempt to run pipeline
    * [ ] Add documentation for how to run methods
* [X] Commit, push, and ping Nishad

# Daily Reflection

* Too specific on some of the tasks. This refactor is pretty gnarly so I'm gonna
  keep it higher level since most of my plans were brittle today.
* Actually ended up spending about half of the day fixing more docker issues,
  specifically around eliminating the dependency on the very specific
  `container_ctl` workflow.
* Second half of the day _started_ to refactor the model, but this is going to
  be a bigger undertaking than I thought at first. I'm trying really hard to
  keep this refactor time-boxed though, so that we have time for the first
  round of tutorials by the end of the month.
* Tomorrow I'll probably have to spend the entire day just refactoring the
  model, without even thinking about `run_methods.jl` (ie. just _part_ of
  deliverable 1.3, where we can generate samples from the prior and visualize
  them without the actual pipeline put together). I do think this is probably
  the heaviest part of the integration (many functions have changed in
  GenSceneGraphs).
