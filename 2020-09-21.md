# Daily Context & Goals

The refactor is blocked on a modeling incompatibility with the GenSceneGraphs
repo. Instead of using 6DoF poses to parameterize slack like in the `master`
branch, Marco and I created a new branch and started using `:slack_z` (single
real-valued scalar) and `:slack_angle` (3D unit vector). This branch is
significantly out of date, and it's unclear if we want to continue to use this
parameterization going forward. Ben has requested a docstring specifying what
exactly the new parameterization is, so he can give a more thoughtful review.
Since the actual code changes were rather small, I suggested it would be easy for me 
to create a new branch from the latest `master` branch, and change the relevant
files, while adding a docstring so he can consider the pros and cons of the new
parameterization without blocking the refactor efforts.

After that, I will work on the [refactor](RefactorDerenderingUsingGenSceneGraphs.md).

# Prospective Tasks

* [ ] Create new branch on GenSceneGraphs with new slack parameterization
* [X] Make docker script that is more sane with our project structure
* [ ] Finish [refactor deliverable (1.3 - model refactor)](RefactorDerenderingUsingGenSceneGraphs.md#Deliverables)
    * [ ] Copy over the model
    * [ ] Refactor `run_methods.jl` to use new visualization, and generally
          clean up the file/add docstrings where relevant.
    * [ ] Run pipeline, fixing 
* [ ] Work on [refactor deliverable (1.4 - `run_methods.jl`)](RefactorDerenderingUsingGenSceneGraphs.md#Deliverables)
    * [ ] Copy over additional baseline heuristics, attempt to run pipeline
    * [ ] Add documentation for how to run methods
* [ ] Commit, push, and ping Nishad
