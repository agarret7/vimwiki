# What I said I would do

* My main goal was to finish the first pass of the [integration](OverlaySceneGraphOnCameraImage.md),
  such that Ben could get a chance to review it early next week,
  and update the GH issues and reviews to be in line with work done.
* An implicit secondary goal was to make use of the new workflow that I set up.
  I also mentioned working on vimwiki several times during the week.


# What I actually did

* I started off the week really strong on [02-09-2020](2020-09-02.md), finishing up core
  deliverbles for the visualization of a single scene graph.
* On [03-09-2020](2020-09-03,md) I completed the core deliverable for multi-particle
  visualization. Some extra time was spent making the actual spec for that
  functionality, and I could sense some hesitation to get started specifically
  because I did not have a clear sense of what that would entail.
* Finally on [04-09-2020](2020-09-04.md), I had some time to create an additional, personal
  milestone of delivering an interpretable tutorial/example demonstrating and
  documenting the current status of the visualization for the rest of the team.
* Notably, I did not improve or upload vimwiki during the week, in
  contradiction to my stated intentions (on two different days).


# What was good

* Creating boundaries between my work and life (respecting and recognizing the
  individual sacredness of each space) was crucial in allowing me to direct a
  larger amount of energy when working because I knew I would have a
  predetermined point to release. On Friday I got into flow for a solid 5 hours.
* Daily meditation was crucial for _letting go_ of my anxieties and attachments
  before coming into work, so that I could focus entirely on coding.
* Very good use of written plans, and lots of coherence with larger scale
  goals. Motivation was very high because of this strong sense of linking up
  daily action to broader purposes.
* To articulate my main complaint about the previous Google Drive notebook
  format, it felt too homogenous and cluttered, and thus facilitated some bad
  habits of not referencing my thoughts from the past. In contrast, Vimwiki
  makes it possible to make deeper hierarchies of knowledge. Think one-way
  transfer of control vs subroutines. In a serialized notebook, entries can
  only jump to specific lines in the overall document, whereas in vimwiki I can
  associate thoughts into trees, which maps much better to conceptual
  abstraction.


# What could be improved

* "Accidentally" was tracking time, instead of intentionally doing so. Not
  sustainable unless intentionally made into part of the planning process.
* Would get distracted by chatting with friends. It's OK to check in with them,
  I just think it should get its own space instead of interrupting flow. Likely
  during a break, or after work.
* Breaks are hard to predict, it would take me a half hour to tell when I was
  getting tired/my attention was wandering.


# Next Steps

## Specific

* Ben will not be able to review the PR until Wednesday. This makes Tuesday an
  excellent day for some broader conceptual work. That is to say, beginning to
  define the scope for some of the abstract goals, and potentially turning
  [SceneGraph Inference Tutorial Sequence](SceneGraphInferenceTutorialSequence.md) into an actual goal.
* The rest of the week will be a tight iterative loop with Ben on the PR,
  completing the first round of integration ASAP. Then we can refine the
  tutorial document and submit for real feedback, while we simultaneously begin
  drafting the sequence of actual tutorials.

## Broader

* Still very important to keep attention on sustaining a basic workflow (it
  takes time to develop healthy habits!), so that should be the main focus for
  next week's process.
* Continue deepening the independence of "work" time and "break" time, to allow
  greater utilization of each. One way may be to pay special attention to the
  times my mind starts wandering off task, and to plan a break sooner rather
  than later.
* Still somewhat weak introspection on larger scale goals. While I referenced
  the larger tasks, I wasn't reshaping them during the week as I proceeded with
  day to day tasks. As part of the daily review, I could reflect on what I've
  learned about the larger goals I was working on, and update them with respect
  to that information.
* Finally, just to reinforce the Next Steps from these weekly reviews, I should
  reference or acknowledge them when I first start to do them or overcome some
  mental block that may prevent me from doing so.
