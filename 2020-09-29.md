# Daily Context & Goals

Working on finishing refactor by cleaning up `run_methods.jl` and `run_evaluation.jl`

My patience threshold has also been surpassed for dealing with graphics issues
on my computer, which has been a persistent source of pain when trying to work,
so I'll spend some time today upgrading my system and drivers to be more stable.


# Prospective Tasks

* [X] Fix computer graphics issues (finally)
* [ ] Address review for metadata visualization PR
* [ ] Address review for structure sampling PR


# Daily Reflection

* TODO
