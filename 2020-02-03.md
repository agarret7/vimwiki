# Questions

* Seed stage, past initial round of funding?

* How many employees?

* Looking for core team still?
 
* What are the general responsibilities and requirements of the job?

* Day-to-day problems in generative modeling and inference?

* Is there anyone I would be working with more closely than the whole team?


# Notes

* 110-130k compensation for companies in series A funding, although I'm aware
  seed stage may have different forms of compensation compared to a more
  established business.
