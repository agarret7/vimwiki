# Abstract Goals
This section serves as more abstract, thesis or research-oriented links that
lack concrete deliverables, and thus are especially susceptible to being
redefined, or eliminated entirely. They can be thought of as "goals unlinked to
robust time estimates". Observables of this process may be concrete goals,
research papers, and conversations with colleagues.

* Infrastructure for SceneGraph Inference Engineering
* Writeup on SceneGraph Inference

# Goals
This section is for units of work on the order of a few weeks to a month. It
makes up the larger scale serialized tasks that advance the abstract goals, but
with clear objectives that are mostly stable and interpretable. Observables of
this process may be images/videos, code snippets, links to GitHub repositories,
issues, and pull requests, and SCRUM table entries. This is the smallest unit
of activity without specific execution plans. The deliverables should then be
specific enough that a daily plan is sufficient to make clear progress without
being confused or lost.

# Open Questions

* What is the purpose of time estimation as distinct from having well-defined
  goals? Is it merely indicative of having a solid plan, or does it serve a
  more independent purpose in planning/execution?
* How do we track risk mitigation and uncertainty?
