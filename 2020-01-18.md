Chapter 5 [10 pages, should include many figures, and enough descirption of the
data that someone can build on it after you’ve left, and coauthor a paper with
you]: Real-world tests

5.1 Metrics
5.2 Dataset
5.3 Neural outliers

Chapter 5: Real-world Data for Scene Graph Models [~5-10 pages, enough figures
and description of the data that someone can build on it after you’ve left, and
coauthor a paper]:
