# Goals
Chapter 5: Real-world Data for Scene Graph Models [~5-10 pages, enough figures and description of the data that someone can build on it after youâ€™ve left, and coauthor a paper]:

5.1 Data Specification
5.2 Metrics
    5.2.1 Modeling: Marginal Likelihood
    5.2.2 Structure Inference: Graph Edit Distance
5.3 Characterizing Neural Detections
    5.3.1 Inlier Detections
    5.3.2 Outlier Detections
5.4 Gradient Descent on Hyperparameters
5.5 Testing RJMCMC Structure Inference

# Tasks
* [ ] Annotate with inliers and outliers
* [ ] Add _improved_ plane detections
* [ ]
