# Goals
Chapter 5: Real-world Data for Scene Graph Models [~5-10 pages, enough figures and description of the data that someone can build on it after youâ€™ve left, and coauthor a paper]:

5.1 Data Specification
5.2 Metrics
    5.2.1 Modeling: Marginal Likelihood
    5.2.2 Structure Inference: Graph Edit Distance
5.3 Characterizing Neural Detections
    5.3.1 Inlier Detections
    5.3.2 Outlier Detections
5.4 Gradient Descent on Hyperparameters
5.5 Testing RJMCMC Structure Inference

# Tasks
* [X] Generate first-pass dope visualization
* [X] Annotate with outliers (needs dope visualization)
* [X] Add simple annotation called gt_structure.json to root level folder
* [X] Add _improved_ plane detections using *add_ground_truth.jl* (gt and detections)
* [X] Generate appropriate visualizations
* [X] Data verification
    * [X] Assert slack rotation is not too large (eg. <30 degrees)
    * [X] DOPE detections (plus the plane)
    * [X] First frame, with overlaid ground truth

Once data is prepared:
* [X] Regenerate inliers figure
* [ ] Analyze outliers
* [ ] Run RJMCMC on each scene *with inliers only*, using default hyperparameters
* [X] Clone model and add param keywords to appropriate hyperparams
* [X] Try gradient descent on hyperparams. If calculation takes too long, run SGD instead.
      Plot marginal likelihood on train/test set over iterations of the algorithm.
* [ ] Run RJMCMC on each scene *with inliers only*, using trained hyperparameters
* [ ] Create a figure (?) showing some qualitative examples of RJMCMC, along with its performance
      before and after training

Alrighty...

After spending some time setting up gradient descent on just the observational model, I found
a fascinating feature 

Performing gradient descent on this data yields an average inlier noise of 2.6 microns,
which is about the size of a bacteria.

Using the pixel density and width of the objects, the detector could
theoretically localize the position of an object to no more than ~0.1 cm.

When I collected this data, I was operating on the assumption that systematic,
correlated error would be less than the uncorrelated noise in the object detector.
It appears that was false, and the noise is almost _entirely_ systematic,
correlated across long stretches of time.
