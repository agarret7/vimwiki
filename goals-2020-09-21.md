# Weekly Context

* Finished the PR last week for the visualization, although we may need some
  minor improvements for the refactor (specifically visualizing metadata).
* We're about to really get into the specification of the tutorial sequence, so
  keeping the refactor time-boxed to this week is quite important.
* Meeting with Vikash on Monday to talk about ways to collaborate with Nishad
  and the broader Cora team.


# Goals
* [X] Resolve issue [GenSceneGraphs#216](https://github.com/probcomp/GenSceneGraphs.jl/issues/216)
* [ ] Finish the [refactor](RefactorDerenderingUsingGenSceneGraphs.md)
* [ ] Finish first pass on [tutorial sequence (will need the weekend)](ImplementTutorialSequence.md)
