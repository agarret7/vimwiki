# Daily Goals

Didn't start planning until 2:30 PM (check daily reflection for more details).

TODO

# Daily Reflection

* Incredibly distracted today, dealing with several issues around my computing
  environment, setting up a new workstation (my nephew took over my old spot),
  and had to pick up my car from a mechanic.
