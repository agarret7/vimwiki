# Daily Context & Goals

I've been feeling pretty confused as to which tasks to work on. Unit testing
has proven to be both highly detailed, and incremental, which makes it feel
like I'm not working toward a broader task. This is similarly reflected in the
way I'm talking about "Unit Testing" instead of WHICH unit tests I want to
complete.

Today I'm going to start by writing down in detail what unit tests we've
already completed, which are roughly:

* Generate from model prior (checks model is not crashing)
* single timestep, single object, checking the logpdf is a constant
  multiplicative factor off from the gaussianVMF.
* Single timestep, two sliding objects with fixed observed slack. Varying the
  latents over a range including the subset [0, observed_slack_offset], and
  visualizing the posterior. Assert the mode of the posterior is in-between
* 

and which unit tests we're thinking about implementing:

* Placeholder
* Placeholder
* Placeholder


Challenges we've run into while unit testing so far:

* Making sure the trace is constrained properly, and that we're not
  accidentally sampling certain latents or observations without realizing it.
  The structure of a unit test is generally: fix some subset of the trace,
    * Solution: Write a `addr_space_is_covered(trace, constrained_vars, sampled_vars)`
      function that checks
      
* Unit tests

# Prospective Tasks

* [X] Meet with Nishad to discuss next unit tests
* [X] Test Ben's constraint code, fix infrastructure
* [ ] Refactor unit tests with new trace constraint infrastructure
