# Goals

Today I want to implement the visualization extensions, such that I can spend
the entirety of Monday generating the new figures, 

# Tasks

* [X] Write out GH issue for visualization extensions
* [X] Talk with Ben about requirements and PR timeline
* [X] Write out pseudocode for scene graph model
    * [X] Main model
    * [X] Parameter initialization
    * [X] Parameter dynamics
    * [X] Observational model


# Reflection

* Was a bit delayed by getting some feedback on the issue, so I switched to
  writing the scene graph model pseudocode figure.
* Will spend the first half of Monday working on the visualization code, and
  the second on preparing the outline PDF and remaining figures for my Slack
  sync with Vikash.
