# Motivation

The work is in a state where it would benefit significantly from outside help
in scene graph inference. Given the homogenous nature of the Derendering repo,
it will be important for us to digest the current work into a simplified and
reusable form. We choose to do this in a form of a [sequence of tutorials](SceneGraphInferenceTutorialSequence.md).
This is crucially a _tutorial_ sequence, rather than a sequence of examples,
specifically because this integration will allow _other people_ to reuse and
modify these examples for their own purposes.
