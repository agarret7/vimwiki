# Daily Context & Goals

Nishad and I are working on unit tests simultaneously, so work is proceeding
quickly. Today I'll work on the slack posterior visualizations for slack, and
creating some basic infrastructure for generating unit tests.


# Prospective Tasks

* [ ] Review Nishad's PR for posterior visualization with varying slack
* [ ] Specify new goal: unit testing GenSceneDerender (15 minutes)
* [ ] Respond to Vikash's comments on unit test design doc
* [ ] Continue adding unit tests to [design doc for unit tests](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Du0mzktc_ihv8I0TlRyG8IrvkqOUpSGNev446GOJCSQ/edit#heading=h.oh5qaafnr88q)


# Daily Reflection

* TODO
