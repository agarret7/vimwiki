# Prospective

1. Filter experiments to a manageable subset that can easily be cleaned up.
2. Annotate outlier in filtered experiments.
3. Plot outlier distribution
4. Marginal likelihood calculation for the noise model over outliers

# Meeting with Nishad
* Annotations
    * Positive detection, pose outlier
    * Negative detection

* Failure modes of DOPE detector
* Analysis of structure inference

* Marginal likelihood calculation of noisy observation model
* Evaluating accuracy of structure inference
* Ground truth pose estimates

# YCB-Video
* Ground-truth poses
* Marginal likelihood
    * Noise model
    * Structure parameters

Talk about subcomponents of the model, we're still motivated by the larger
model.

# ProbComp-Structure
* Static objects, filtering out flicker:
    * Marginal likelihood calculation for noise model
* New dataset with interesting structure, walking around the scene


* Evaluating structure inference, and demonstrations
* Filter out bad experiments that have too many pose detections
* Generate interpolation

* Pose outliers with YCB-Video

# Tasks

1. Start with 10 structured scenes. No motion, but with occlusion.
