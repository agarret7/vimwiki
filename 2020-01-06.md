# Prospective

1. Filter experiments to a manageable subset that can easily be cleaned up.
2. Annotate outlier in filtered experiments.
3. Plot outlier distribution
4. Marginal likelihood calculation for the noise model over outliers

Tonight I want to give at least a sense for what data and results I'm collecting in the first place. So explicitly you can tell Vikash to expect results on a small test subset (~20 frames):
Figure characterizing the outliers over neural pose detections
Figure showing evaluation of structure inference (using graph edit distance metric)

Additionally I'll link to videos of the data I've collected, so explicit feedback on two fronts would be helpful:
Does the data look 
On the results
