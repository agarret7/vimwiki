# Daily Context & Goals

Past two days were less productive than I wanted, I got a bit too caught up in
working on my linux environment (fixing the graphical issue led to a
rabbit-hole of tweaking settings and configurations), and let myself slide on
my lab notebook.

Today I'll work on refactoring the baseline methods.


# Prospective Tasks

* [X] Fix unscented kalman filter baseline in the refactor
* [X] Fix deinterpenetration baseline in the refactor
* [ ] Fix edge heuristic baseline in the refactor


# Daily Reflection

* Blocked on fixing the edge heuristic until we add a conversion from the Hopf
  parameterization to a 6DoF pose.
