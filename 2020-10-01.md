# Daily Context & Goals

Past two days were less productive than I wanted, I got a bit too caught up in
working on my linux environment (fixing the graphical issue led to a
rabbit-hole of tweaking settings and configurations), and let myself slide on
my lab notebook.


# Prospective Tasks

* [ ] Fix unscented kalman filter baseline in the refactor
* [ ] Fix deinterpenetration baseline in the refactor
* [ ] Fix edge heuristic baseline in the refactor
