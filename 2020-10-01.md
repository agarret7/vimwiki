# Daily Context & Goals

Past two days were less productive than I wanted, I got a bit too caught up in
working on my linux environment (fixing the graphical issue led to a
rabbit-hole of tweaking settings and configurations), and let myself slide on
my lab notebook.


# Prospective Tasks

* [ ] Fix baseline refactor
* [ ] Address review for metadata visualization PR
* [ ] Address review for structure sampling PR


# Daily Reflection

* TODO
