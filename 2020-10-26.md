# Daily Context & Goals

Nishad is working on finishing up [Unit Testing](GenSceneDerenderUnitTesting.md) for the scene graph model
(soft deadline on Wednesday), specifically finishing up the robust noisy
pose likelihood test (ie. visualizing posterior over flicker frames), and
visualizing the joint posterior over structures for already existing unit
tests.

I'm beginning to implement inference tests, specifically starting with a very
simple two object scene with fixed structure, trying to infer sliding/floating
structure for two objects in a simple configuration, maybe varying sliding pose
offset slightly.


# Prospective Tasks

* [X] Partition existing unit tests into their own separate files
* [X] Implement simple sliding scene with unknown/randomly sampled structure
* [X] Run and debug inference on scene
* [ ] Visualize approximated posterior
* [ ] Compare to gridded posterior
