# Daily Context

Ben won't be able to work on the PR until tomorrow, and the first part of the
day is taken up mostly by meetings. Given that at the end of last week I
finished quite a bit of the integration, today is a good day to reflect on
longer-term goals and specify more detailed plans.

# Prospective Tasks

* [X] Review and edit [Overlay SceneGraphs on Camera Image](OverlaySceneGraphOnCameraImage.md) motivation
* [o] Spec the [Scene Graph Inference Tutorial Sequence](SceneGraphInferenceTutorialSequence.md)
    * [X] Spec the [refactor](RefactorDerenderingUsingGenSceneGraphs.md)
    * [ ] Spec the [tutorials](ImplementTutorialSequence.md)

# Daily Reflection

* Sort of impromptu decided to write out weekly goals, which felt missing in
  last week's [review](review-04-09-2020.md). IE. I made a whole section on what I said I would do for
  the week, which was implicit in my daily goals but wasn't explicitly stated anywhere.
* Quite a few distractions today. I started with meetings in the morning, and
  had to bring my car to a mechanic later in the afternoon. That made it
  difficult to do some of the abstract and ill-defined work required in
  specifying goals. In general, when writing longer-term goals I should pay
  special attention to reducing distractions so I can remain mindful of the
  broader context that needs to be considered when structuring a coherent
  long-term goal.
* Didn't get to specifying the tutorial sequence. I forgot that I wanted to ask
  for Vikash's assistance on that point, so it may be better to wait until
  after the refactor to tackle that task.
