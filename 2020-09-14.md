# Daily Context & Goals

Meetings, meetings, meetings.

Getting into a productive coding flow will likely be impossible, except
possibly between 2 - 4 PM, and I have a few workflow and project management
tasks beforehand to take care of.

I should should then be focused on writing out the workflow, as mentioned in
[last week's review](review-2020-09-11.md#Broader), with flexibility to do a
coding block somewhere in-between 2 PM and 4 PM. The workflow should be split
along internal and external processes.

# Prospective Tasks

* [ ] Document workflow
    * [ ] Internal: Goals, plans, reviews, calendar
    * [ ] External: Meetings, standups, SCRUM
* [ ] Plan 2-4 PM

# Daily Reflection

* TODO
