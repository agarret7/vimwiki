# Daily Context & Goals

Meetings, meetings, meetings.

Getting into a productive coding flow will likely be impossible, except between
2 - 4 PM, and I have a few workflow and project management tasks beforehand to
take care of.

The first part of the day should then be focused on writing out the workflow,
as mentioned in [last week's review](review-2020-09-11.md#Broader). Split along internal and external processes.


# Prospective Tasks

* [ ] Document workflow
    * [ ] Internal: Goals, plans, reviews, calendar
    * [ ] External: Meetings, standups, SCRUM
* [ ] Prepare for Cora meeting
    * [ ] Describe current integration status
    * [ ] Describe refactor plans
    * [ ] Talk about projected start date for tutorial sequence
* [ ] Plan 2-4 PM


# Daily Reflection

* TODO
