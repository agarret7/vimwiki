# Daily Context & Goals

Meetings, meetings, meetings.

Getting into a productive coding flow will likely be impossible, except
possibly between 2 - 4 PM, and I have a few workflow and project management
tasks beforehand to take care of.

I should should then be focused on writing out the workflow, as mentioned in
[last week's review](review-2020-09-11.md#Broader), with flexibility to do a coding block somewhere in-between
2 PM and 4 PM. The workflow should be split along internal and external processes.

# Prospective Tasks

* [o] Document workflow
    * [X] Internal: Goals, plans, reviews, calendar
    * [ ] External: Meetings, standups, SCRUM

# Daily Reflection

* Feeling very tired after my meeting with Ben (ended at 2:30 PM).
* Wrote my [workflow spec](WorkflowSpec.md).
