# Prospective Tasks
* [X] Respond to Ben's PR review iteration
* [X] Talk with Nishad about flicker test issue where posterior probability of
      flicker is much higher than it should be.
* [X] Explore continuous vs discrete random variables, and specifically how
      continuous variables can have positive logpdf, which leads to some of the issues
      in the flicker test.


# Daily Reflection

* Imagine we have a model like

```julia
x ~ Uniform(-0.5,0.5)
if (outlier ~ bernoulli(0.5))
    y ~ Uniform(-0.5,0.5)
else
    y ~ Normal(x, 0.001)
end
```

  then the posterior prob of `outlier` given some value of `y` is going to be
  lower, due to the Bayesian Occam's razor. That is, the stdev of the inlier
  hypothesis is so low compared to the outlier, that the logpdf of the inlier
  observation 
* For our robust noisy pose likelihood, we have a inlier stdev of 0.5 cm,
  whereas the outlier is a uniform over a meter cube on each side. Even if we
  place a vast majority of the observational density mass on the uniform
  component (prob_outlier > 0.999), the posterior probability of an outlier
  shrinks to approximately zero, because the outlier hypothesis space is so
  much broader than the gaussian mixture component, its logpdf is much much
  greater than the score under the uniform density.
* Tomorrow I can work on what I said I'd do for this week: "Next week I'll take
  a look at adding proposals for the slack parameters in the sliding data
  driven proposal. If that doesn't change the behavior of this test much, I'll
  isolate a test enumerating over structure, latent params, and/or slack, and
  see where the mode of the joint posterior lies."
* I can also help Nishad construct a sequence of figures to demonstrate this
  problem to Vikash and get some advice on what to do.
