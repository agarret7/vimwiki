# Daily Context & Goals

I worked on simplifying and clarifying [workflow](WorkflowSpec.md) yesterday. My calendar is now
up-to-date, so I have better visibility on where my time is going.

Meeting times are a bit sporadic today, so flow will be difficult to sustain
(why concretely though?) We still have to wrap up the last parts of the PR
review, but that should be done in a short period of time ~30 mins.

Otherwise, the [refactor](RefactorDerenderingUsingGenSceneGraphs.md) now has full focus, so that's the majority of what
I'm working on today.

# Prospective Tasks

* [X] Meet with Nishad to walk through Scene Graph modeling and inference code
    * [X] Mention that you may want him to test the refactor
* [X] Address final PR review comments for the integration
* [X] Refine [refactor spec](RefactorDerenderingUsingGenSceneGraphs.md) (30 minutes at most)
    * [X] Respecify deliverables in terms of other people independently
          reproducing results from the pipeline
    * [X] Expand deliverables to make explicit what the various outputs/end
          states are.
* [ ] TODO: Deliverables for refactor

# Daily Reflection

* I did not work on the refactor today.
* Yesterday was likely mostly an improper use of time. I do not need to get my
  calendar perfect. I do not need to formalize my workflow. I need to use my
  workflow in concrete daily actions.
