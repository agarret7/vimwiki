# Daily Context & Goals

I worked on simplifying and clarifying [workflow](WorkflowSpec.md) yesterday. My calendar is now
up-to-date, so I have better visibility on where my time is going.

Meeting times are a bit sporadic today, so flow will be difficult to sustain.
We still have to wrap up the last parts of the PR review, but that should be
done in a short period of time ~30 mins.

Otherwise, the [refactor](RefactorDerenderingUsingGenSceneGraphs.md) now has full focus, so that's the majority of what
I'm working on today.

# Prospective Tasks

* [ ] Meet with Nishad to walk through Scene Graph modeling and inference code
    * [ ] Mention that you may want him to test the refactor
* [ ] Address final PR review comments for the integration
* [ ] Refine [refactor spec](RefactorDerenderingUsingGenSceneGraphs.md) (30 minutes at most)
    * [ ] Respecify deliverables in terms of other people independently
          reproducing results from the pipeline
    * [ ] Expand deliverables to make explicit what the various outputs/end
          states are.
* [ ] TODO: Deliverables for refactor

# Daily Reflection

* TODO
