# Daily Goals

Check-in with Ben to get feedback on goals and plans, and to update about the
PR. There may be some restructuring of broader goals and today's tasks
depending on the outcome of that conversation.

Currently we

# Prospective Tasks

* [ ] Iterate on PR review
* [o] Spec the [Scene Graph Inference Tutorial Sequence](SceneGraphInferenceTutorialSequence.md)
    * [ ] Begin the [refactor](RefactorDerenderingUsingGenSceneGraphs.md)
    * [ ] Spec the [tutorials](ImplementTutorialSequence.md)

# Daily Reflection

* Sort of impromptu decided to write out weekly goals, which felt missing in
  last week's [review](review-04-09-2020.md). IE. I made a whole section on
  what I said I would do for the week, which was implicit in my daily goals but
  wasn't explicitly stated anywhere.
* Quite a few distractions today. I started with meetings in the morning, and
  had to bring my car to a mechanic later in the afternoon. That made it
  difficult to do some of the abstract and ill-defined work required in
  specifying goals. In general, when writing longer-term goals I should pay
  special attention to reducing distractions so I can remain mindful of the
  broader context that needs to be considered when structuring a coherent
  long-term goal.
* Didn't get to specifying the tutorial sequence. I forgot that I wanted to ask
  for Vikash's assistance on that point, so it may be better to wait until
  after the refactor to tackle that task.
