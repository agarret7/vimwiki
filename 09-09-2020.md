# Daily Goals

Check-in with Ben to get feedback on goals and plans, and to update about the
PR. There may be some restructuring of broader goals and today's tasks
depending on the outcome of that conversation.

Currently expecting Ben to need some time to review the PR, so while he's doing
that I can reasonably begin the refactor process, built on top of the current
working branch. We can then move dependencies to master once the PR is merged.

Deliverables around YCB-Video [(2.1.1, 2.2.1)](RefactorDerenderingUsingGenSceneGraphs.md#Deliverables) may be blocked on some work
Javier needed to do with the plane detector. They are not on the critical path
for the tutorial sequence (we may even want to drop them as deliverables for
the refactor, and wait until they become relevant after the tutorial sequence).
For now we'll just skip them.

Writing the `README.md` will be difficult before refactoring, so we'll do that
in an iterative fashion as we complete the refactor (adding docs as we add the
functionality).
