# Weekly Context




# Goals

* [X] Complete independent model testing (Nishad taking on these tasks):
    * [X] Finish flicker frame test that will help us to debug continuous
          parameter inference with the robust noisy pose likelihood
    * [X] Visualize joint posterior over structure in existing model tests.
* [X] First pass of structure inference testing
    * [X] Simple single-frame with two objects recovers correct posterior over
          structure
    * [X] STRETCH: static structure, multi-frame with two objects recovers
          correct posterior over structure
