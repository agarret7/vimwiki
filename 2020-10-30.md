# Daily Context & Goals

I have a dream.

That dream is that I test non-robust continuous parameter inference today, and
integrate it with the full-stack model so we have inference on a simple dynamic
scene with synthetic data.

I have another round of review for Ben's PR, and I also have to respond to his
round of PR review for the metadata visualization and structure sampling. The
former is more important, since it blocks Ben. The latter can be pushed to the
afternoon, or weekend depending on how much time it takes to implement the full
stack (which could quite possibly be all day).


# Prospective Tasks

* [ ] Review Ben's PR on default views
* [X] Add trace sequence visualization
* [X] Add non-robust continuous parameter inference test with static object
* [X] Add non-robust continuous parameter inference test with two static
      sliding objects
* [ ] Add non-robust continuous parameter inference test with dynamic object
* [ ] Add non-robust continuous parameter inference test with two dynamic
      sliding objects
* [ ] Duplicate structure inference tests with continuous parameter inference
      as a precursor
