# Goals

* Mon: Finish structure visualization PR. Generate figures using complete
       visualization suite, as unit tests.
* Tue: Implement marginal likelihood calculation, based on enumeration, as well
       as KL divergence calculation. Clean up model and inference unit tests, and 
* Wed: Setup environment and collect new In-House scenes focused on simple
       structure changes with YCB objects. Aim for ~25 scenes, with reproducible
       process for collecting new scenes (so that you can add even more otherwise).
       Annotation script cleanup, and annotating each scene. Also run annotation
       script on YCB-Video.
* Thur: Begin evaluation using marginal likelihood calculation (basic, don't
        stress too much about complex analyses. I can ask for suggestions from
        Vikash, Marco, Nishad on tests to run).
* Fri: Off? Otherwise, flex day for catching up
