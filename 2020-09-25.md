# Daily Context & Goals

Main part of the [refactor](RefactorDerenderingUsingGenSceneGraphs.md) that still needs to be done is inference, and
including baseline methods. The evaluation pipeline should be almost entirely
unchanged, since that code is completely independent of the dependencies.

It will be important for the tutorials to finish [GenSceneGraphs#216](https://github.com/probcomp/GenSceneGraphs.jl/issues/216), so I'll
allocate some time today to work on that.

Inference


# Prospective Tasks

* [ ] Make PR for model refactor into master branch of GenSceneDerender, and
      request Nishad's review
* [ ] Begin refactor of `inference.jl`
* [ ] Clean up `run_methods.jl` refactor 
* [ ] 


# Daily Reflection

* Shorter plans are actually better, and more useful. Most important part is
  connecting to the higher level goal, not specifying in excruciating detail
  what I need to do to finish the task, because those almost always break.
