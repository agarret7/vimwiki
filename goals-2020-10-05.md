# Weekly Context

* Last week was more shoddy on written tasks and plans. Getting back on track
  this week.
* Still have the PR reviews to do for GenSceneGraphs, but refactor now is ~80%
  finished. Missing components include: model refactor with Hopf geodesic
  parameterization, edge heuristic baseline, metadata visualization for
  `run_methods.jl`, and pose inaccuracies in the real-world data set. Estimated
  time to finish this is one day of focused work.
* Major difference in the refactor was model code, so that may be more broken
  than the actual repository infrastructure and file format. It will require
  careful unit testing to ensure it's in working state.
* This week, we'll put a pause on the remaining refactor (which is not on a
  critical path to our next steps in inference debugging), to implement
  synthetic unit tests of the model and inference code.


# Goals

* [ ] Respond to PR review by Ben on the metadata vis, and structure sampling code
* [ ] Add conversion code in model for Hopf geodesic parameterization -> 6DoF slack
* [ ] Implement basic unit tests to assure scene graph model correctness
* [ ] Design more complex unit tests (and request review by Vikash) to explore
      the bugs we were encountering in modeling/inference.
