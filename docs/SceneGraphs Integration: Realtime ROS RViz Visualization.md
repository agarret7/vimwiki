# Motivation
Integrating the visualization used to render visualizations and metrics of
scenegraphs in realtime using the RViz 3D visualization tool in ROS. Support
for online debugging ("visualization in the loop"). Creating the beginnings of
support for longer-term robotics application of scenegraph inference via an
investment in ROS infrastructure.

# Deliverables
Code is documented, and pushed to a branch of GenSceneGraphs.jl. A pull request
is submitted to Ben. The following unit tests are implemented and demonstrated
to work.
