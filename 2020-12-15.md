# Daily Context

Finally heading back into the office after COVID-19, so I can control &
separate my work/living arrangements, which is important for focus.

Unexpectedly setting up a standing desk with my brother earlier in the day,
which is replacing my workstation at his office.

After that, I want to work on figures for chapter 2, hopefully getting them
mostly knocked out today/tomorrow (depends on the spec I develop for them).

In fact, I think I'll try to knock out the entire chapter today, so that I can
roughly work on one chapter per day before the weekend, which should give a
really solid first draft of each chapter before the holidays.


# Prospective Tasks
