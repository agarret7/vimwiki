# Daily Context

Finally heading back into the office after COVID-19, so I can control &
separate my work/living arrangements, which is important for focus.

Unexpectedly setting up a standing desk with my brother earlier in the day,
which is replacing my workstation at his office.

After that, I want to work on figures for chapter 2, hopefully getting them
mostly knocked out today/tomorrow (depends on the spec I develop for them).

In fact, I think I'll try to knock out the entire chapter today, so that I can
roughly work on one chapter per day before the weekend, which should give a
really solid first draft of each chapter before the holidays.


# Prospective Tasks

* [X] Assemble standing desk
* [X] Spec out figures for chapter 2
* [X] Fig 2-1: What is a scene graph
* [X] Fig 2-2: Scene graph dynamics
* [ ] Fig 2-3: Generative program representation of scene graphs
* [X] Fig 2-4: Cora synthetic scene
* [X] Fig 2-5: Real-world YCB objects scene


# Daily Reflection

* Putting figures [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TgSaq6O0EQeVf1COgDjimLVgo044XAJolHAl-GZZdwQ/edit?usp=sharing).
* Still missing one of the big figures (source code) for this chapter, so I'll
  have to fit that in on a day where I have less figures to generate.
