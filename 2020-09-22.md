# Daily Context & Goals

Great discussion [here](https://probcomp.slack.com/archives/CJWB46MME/p1600790212015800) on Rotations, culminating in Marco deciding
to refactor [Gen3DRotations](https://github.com/probcomp/Gen3DRotations.jl) into a broader repo called GenDirectionalStats,
which will depend on Rotations.jl


# Prospective Tasks

* [ ] Create new branch on GenSceneGraphs with new slack parameterization
* [X] Make docker script that is more sane with our project structure
* [.] Finish [refactor deliverable (1.3 - model refactor)](RefactorDerenderingUsingGenSceneGraphs.md#Deliverables)
    * [X] Copy over the model
    * [ ] Refactor `run_methods.jl` to use new visualization, and generally
          clean up the file/add docstrings where relevant.
* [ ] Work on [refactor deliverable (1.4 - `run_methods.jl`)](RefactorDerenderingUsingGenSceneGraphs.md#Deliverables)
    * [ ] Copy over additional baseline heuristics, attempt to run pipeline
    * [ ] Add documentation for how to run methods
* [X] Commit, push, and ping Nishad

# Daily Reflection

* Too specific on some of the tasks. This refactor is pretty gnarly so I'm gonna
  keep it higher level since most of my plans were brittle today.
* Actually ended up spending about half of the day fixing more docker issues,
  specifically around eliminating the dependency on the very specific
  `container_ctl` workflow.
* Second half of the day _started_ to refactor the model, but this is going to
  be a bigger undertaking than I thought at first. I'm trying really hard to
  keep this refactor time-boxed though, so that we have time for the first
  round of tutorials by the end of the month.
* Tomorrow I'll probably have to spend the entire day just refactoring the
  model, without even thinking about `run_methods.jl` (ie. just _part_ of
  deliverable 1.3, where we can generate samples from the prior and visualize
  them without the actual pipeline put together). I do think this is probably
  the heaviest part of the integration (many functions have changed in
  GenSceneGraphs).
