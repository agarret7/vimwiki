# Daily Context & Goals

Great discussion [here](https://probcomp.slack.com/archives/CJWB46MME/p1600790212015800) on Rotations, culminating in Marco deciding
to refactor [Gen3DRotations](https://github.com/probcomp/Gen3DRotations.jl) into a broader repo called GenDirectionalStats,
which will depend on [Rotations.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeometry/Rotations.jl) and implement distributions and basic MCMC
moves for S1, S2, and SO3. This is a more elegant formulation, and unblocks
the refactor efforts


# Prospective Tasks

* [ ] Discuss GenDirectionalStats refactor with Marco and Ben
* [ ] Continue refactoring model, using new interface for rotations
* [ ] Commit, push, and ping Nishad

# Daily Reflection

* TODO
