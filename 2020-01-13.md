Few questions:

Should I cut section 3.2.2? I'm unsure if it's too verbose to describe a relatively simple visualization, and I think it potentially could be merged with the section below.
Is the usage of math notation helpful (especially in 3.2.3), or distracting (given that the terms I use will be defined in more depth in Chapter 2)?
Should I improve the distinguishability of the color scheme in the renderings, or do you think it's fine as is?
Are there any sections you feel in particular could use some editing?
