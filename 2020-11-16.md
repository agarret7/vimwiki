Current plan:

1. Run DOPE on current PCG dataset, hand label with inlier/outlier labels
2. Fit hyper-parameters by implementing a function.

Rough sketch:
* Once you run into problems, it's important to have a reproducible,
  quantitative evaluation
* Maybe we could heuristically tune these parameters

* There's a general class of probabilistic models:
    * Take the output of some detector, and model those detections

Running a particle filter to track objects without scene graph structure
Fixing this key modeling problem that errors are assumed to be independent.
