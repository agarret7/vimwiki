# Motivation

Given the longer time horizon for the M.Eng, weâ€™ve shifted priorities towards
integrating existing work/infrastructure into the broader Cora project before
proceeding with improved inference engineering.

The bulk of the next month will be focused on carefully
documenting and refactoring the visualization components from the SceneGraphs
project.
