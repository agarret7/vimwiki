# Daily Context & Goals

TODO

# Prospective Tasks

* [ ] Review Nishad's PR on utilities for enumerating over addresses in the
      model.


# Daily Reflection

* Good day today, unblocked myself from specifying some of the unit tests.
* Tomorrow I can work on:
    * Visualize structure posterior in the various tests.
    * Visualizing the slack in the metadata visualization.
    * Check Nishad's test on outliers (potentially extend it?)
    * Visualize prior samples in the model
    * Set up physically plausible multi-frame scene, and visualize crucial
      aspects like structure posterior
    * Switch the slack offset vs logpdf at latents == observations to visualize
      the posterior
