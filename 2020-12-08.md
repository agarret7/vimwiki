# Notes and Daily Context

Vikash provided a pretty thoroughly-detailed suggested outline:

Chapter 1 [3-5 pages]: Introduction
1.1. the problem: we have scene graph models, but how can we test if they work?
1.2. summary of this thesis

Chapter 2 [10 pages, ~5 figures]: Background on Generative Scene Graphs
2.1 Mathematical description
2.2 Representation as a generative program
2.3 Example scene graph models
2.3.1 YCB objects on a synthetic tabletop
2.3.2 Real YCB objects on a physical tabletop
2.3.3 Simulated objects in an AI2Thor simulation [from Ben and
      Nishad’s use cases]

Chapter 3 [5 pages, ~5 figures]: Visualizing Inference
3.1 Desiderata
3.2 Examples [should include lots of your nice overlay renderings, multiple
              particles, etc]

Chapter 4 [5-10 pages, as many figures as needed]: Tests of Inference by Enumeration
4.1 Enumerative inference
4.2 - 4.5 examples
4.6 Lessons for improving scene graph priors

Chapter 5 [10 pages, should include many figures, and enough description of the
           data that someone can build on it after you’ve left, and coauthor a paper with
           you]: Real-world tests
5.1 Metrics
5.2 MIT In-House
5.3 YCB Video

Chapter 6 [5 pages]: Conclusion

Today I'll work on editing and fleshing this out into a document that will
structure my writing process for the thesis. I also have some emails I need to
write for next steps.


# Prospective Tasks

* [X] Write email to S3 asking about flexibility on thesis deadline due to COVID-19
* [X] Write email to David & Dan about potential work at MIT/IBM lab
* [X] Write email to EECS UG office about registration issue
* [ ] Finish SecondMind AI Cover Letter
* [X] Add subsections, and proposed figures to thesis outline.


# Daily Review

* [New Thesis outline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eDbjSHduuAeg2ZryZrF0AzHIrApqtMP8_0SyAvlQet0/edit)
* Tomorrow will work on scoping out figures with more detail, and writing out
  the plan for making each figure, as well as a scope of work if anything extra
  needs to be implemented in the Cora repository.
* Will also develop a brief plan for wrapping up remaining pull requests, and
  implementing
