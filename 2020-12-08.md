# Notes and Daily Context

Vikash provided a pretty thoroughly-detailed suggested outline:

Chapter 1 [3-5 pages]: Introduction
1.1. the problem: we have scene graph models, but how can we test if they work?
1.2. summary of this thesis

Chapter 2 [10 pages, ~5 figures]: Background on Generative Scene Graphs
2.1 Mathematical description
2.2 Representation as a generative program
2.3 Example scene graph models
2.3.1 YCB objects on a synthetic tabletop
2.3.2 Real YCB objects on a physical tabletop
2.3.3 Simulated objects in an AI2Thor simulation [from Ben and
      Nishad’s use cases]

Chapter 3 [5 pages, ~5 figures]: Visualizing Inference
3.1 Desiderata
3.2 Examples [should include lots of your nice overlay renderings, multiple
              particles, etc]

Chapter 4 [5-10 pages, as many figures as needed]: Tests of Inference by Enumeration
4.1 Enumerative inference
4.2 - 4.5 examples
4.6 Lessons for improving scene graph priors

Chapter 5 [10 pages, should include many figures, and enough descirption of the data that someone can build on it after you’ve left, and coauthor a paper with you]: Real-world tests
5.1 Metrics
5.2 MIT IN-House
5.3 YCB Video

Chapter 6 [5 pages]: Conclusion
