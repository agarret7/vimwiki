# Motivation

We need a set of static examples to explore and debug scene graph inference in
a methodical way. This will allow us to isolate and work on specific problems
arising in modeling and inference, and to set out clearly-defined scenarios
that when completed will demonstrate the performance of scene graph.

These unit tests can also be rather easily turned into tutorial examples, but
are geared toward the hard and detail-oriented work of inference debugging.
