# Daily Context

Working on the chapter pertaining to visualizations of inference.


# Prospective Tasks

* [ ] Make thesis figure branch of Derendering
* [ ] Fig 3-1: Single frame render from test
* [ ] Fig 3-2: 
* [ ] Fig 3-3: Structure visualization
* [ ] Fig 3-4: Multiple particles
* [ ] Fig 3-5: Metadata visualization


# Daily Reflection

* Things to implement in a PR:
    * Implementation of graphviz renderer:
        * Optional filter of objects by name
        * Optional specification of color scheme (for consistency with main render)
    * Implementation of image scaler:
        * Scales image by min(width/dot_width, height/dot_height)
        * Pads image to fill remaining dimension
    * Implementation of a horizontal image compositor:
        * Uses image scaler to scale second image to same height as first image
        * Returns concatenated image
    * Implementation of a graph distribution renderer:
        * Calculates distribution over structure

* Once that PR is completed (not blocked on review):
    * Can generate figure 3-3 as a stand-alone rendering of the structure
