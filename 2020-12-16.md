# Daily Context

Working on the chapter pertaining to visualizations of inference.


# Prospective Tasks

* [ ] Make thesis figure branch of Derendering
* [X] Fig 3-1: Single frame render from test
* [ ] Draft complete plan for remaining work on the thesis


# Daily Reflection

* Realized I am not going to have the figures done by Monday, or likely even by
  the holidays. Instead of completing this goal, I have a much more granular
  and detailed plan for the execution of the remaining components of the
  thesis.

* I've realized what I really need to do to get this thesis done. It will take
  1-2 weeks of implementation to create the remaining code for the thesis,
  which I will do during the intermediate time from Christmas to New Years (I'm
  genuinely fine working through this period instead of taking a break, since
  I'll have a healthy break after I jump into my thesis).
* Breaks down to two parts: PR for additional visualization capacity, and a set
  of evaluations on YCB-InHouse and YCB-Video datasets.

* Things to implement in a PR:
    * Implementation of graphviz renderer:
        * Optional filter of objects by name
        * Optional specification of color scheme (for consistency with main
          render)
    * Implementation of image scaler:
        * Scales image by min(width/dot_width, height/dot_height)
        * Pads image to fill remaining dimension
    * Implementation of a horizontal image compositor:
        * Uses image scaler to scale second image to same height as first image
        * Returns concatenated image
    * Implementation of a graph structure distribution renderer:
        * Calculates distribution over structure

* Once that PR is completed (not blocked on review):
    * Generate figure 3-3 as a stand-alone rendering of the structure of the
      single scene.
    * Generate figure 3-4 as an aggregate of multiple particles composited with
      graph structure distribution renderer.

* Chapter 4 will mostly be taking figures from existing tests that we've
  implemented in the unit tests, plus leveraging some marginal likelihood
  calculation and KL divergence code to actually benchmark performance on these
  models (discussed below).

* Chapter 5 will require additional facilities in GenSceneDerender:
    * Implementation of marginal likelihood calculation
    * Implementation of KL divergence calculation
    * Implementation of automatic testing on additional annotations

* We need to add some additional features to the datasets
    * We need to annotate YCB-Video with static structure, and 
        * Afterwards we can do a full analysis of the performance of the robust
          and nonrobust noise models in isolation across the dataset.
        * We can do a weaker analysis of the overall structure prediction
          performance (both modeling and inference) using edit distance, and
          pose distance using average pose over particles, and the mode of
          inferred structure.
