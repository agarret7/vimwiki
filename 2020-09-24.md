# Daily Context & Goals

Yesterday was a slower day. I woke up late and wasn't feeling too well, so I
took it easy and today I'm feeling much better. I worked a bit on the refactor,
mostly around the `run_methods.jl` pipeline and got it into a working state
(still needs a bit of cleanup).

I think it is possible to finish the model refactor today, since I finally have
a view on the remaining dependencies. I need to create a pull request for
integrating structure generation code, which will probably take a large portion
of the day. After this, finishing the model refactor will take a few hours.

This *will* create some tech debt for the inference code.
