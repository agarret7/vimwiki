# Daily Context & Goals

Yesterday was a slower day. I woke up late and wasn't feeling too well, so I
took it easy and today I'm feeling much better. I worked a bit on the refactor,
mostly around the `run_methods.jl` pipeline and got it into a working state
(still needs a bit of cleanup).

I think it is possible to finish the model refactor today, since I finally have
a view on the remaining dependencies. I need to create a pull request for
integrating structure generation code, which will probably take a large portion
of the day. After this, finishing the model refactor will take a few hours.

This *will* create some tech debt for the inference code. However, the
integration of sampling code into GenSceneGraphs will be very valuable for
others working on scene graph modeling.


# Prospective Tasks

* [O] GenSceneGraphs PR on structure sampling
    * [X] Copy over interface code for structure sampling
    * [X] Replace UndirectedSpanningTree with LightGraphs.Graph
    * [X] Replace DirectedSpanningTree with LightGraphs.DiGraph
    * [X] Copy over tests to test file, make sure they run
    * [ ] Push and ping Ben with PR
* [X] Refactor modeling code

# Daily Reflection

* Finished both the structure PR, and the model refactor :)
* Finally, actually finishing something I plan in the day.
