# Daily Context & Goals

Let's keep it straightforward and to-the-point today. I need to finish the
model refactor, so we can begin implementing very basic unit tests


# Prospective Tasks

* [X] Fix unscented kalman filter baseline in the refactor
* [X] Fix deinterpenetration baseline in the refactor
* [ ] Fix edge heuristic baseline in the refactor


# Daily Reflection

* Blocked on fixing the edge heuristic until we add a conversion from the Hopf
  parameterization to a 6DoF pose.
