# Daily Context & Goals

Let's keep it straightforward and to-the-point today. I need to finish the
model refactor, and begin implementing some very basic checks to ensure the
semantic correctness of the modeling/inference code.

Other than that, I want to move towards closing the PR's for GenSceneGraphs
that were spawned by the refactor, and continue designing the review doc.

I should also spend a little bit of time updating high-level goals, since we've
added a new goal (Unit Testing GenSceneDerender), and the refactor objectives
have shifted slightly.


# Prospective Tasks

* [X] Review [Ben's PR for geodesic Hopf parameterization of PlanarContact](https://github.com/probcomp/GenSceneGraphs.jl/pull/231)
* [X] Add geodesic Hopf parameterization of PlanarContact to GenSceneDerender model
* [X] Respond to Ben's PR reviews for [metadata vis](https://github.com/probcomp/GenSceneGraphs.jl/pull/226)
* [X] Respond to Ben's PR reviews for [structure sampling](https://github.com/probcomp/GenSceneGraphs.jl/pull/225)
* [ ] Implement basic unit tests for model
    * [ ] Single object, static scene, gridding GaussianVMF
    * [ ] Two objects, static scene, moving latent and observation together and
          seeing posterior probability on structure.
* [ ] Continue adding unit tests to [design doc for unit tests](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Du0mzktc_ihv8I0TlRyG8IrvkqOUpSGNev446GOJCSQ/edit#heading=h.oh5qaafnr88q)
* [ ] Specify new goal: unit testing GenSceneDerender


# Daily Reflection

* TODO
