# Goals

Implementation of the [GraphViz visualization extensions](https://github.com/probcomp/GenSceneGraphs.jl/issues/266).

Production of thesis figures, clarification of outline.

By end of day, doc for Vikash to review on Tues and Weds on current status of
thesis.


# Tasks

* [X] image manipulation utilities
    * [X] Function scaling a given image to fit into a specified(width, height)
          window, by scaling the image by a factor of min(width/dot_width,
          height/dot_height), and padding the scaled image along the dimension
          that is not matched.
    * [X] Image compositor function; takes in an images::Matrix{Image},
          rowHeights::Vector{Int}, columnWidths::Vector{Int} and returns an
          image collage with each image images[i,j] scaled to fit into a window
          of shape (rowHeights[i], columnWidths[j]).
* [ ] GraphViz Visualization
    * [ ] Function returning graphviz rendering as an Image datatype (instead of a graphviz DiGraph):
        * [ ] Optional filter of objects by name
        * [ ] Optional specification of color scheme (for consistency with overlaySceneGraph functions)
    * [ ] Function taking in a list of scene graphs, and returns a rendered visualization of the structure distribution:
        * [ ] Calculates structure frequency
        * [ ] Renders the top k most frequent structures
        * [ ] Composites them horizontally, with frequency annotated below the structure

* [ ] Thesis figure generation
* [ ] Complete thesis outline
