* Q: Do we infer slack noise?
  A: Fixed slack variance in current model.
* Interactively adjust the expected slack, skew it very high or very low, and
  see what happens in the static case.

* Fix the model so true posterior modes are in the right place, tested using
  enumeration.

* Working with inference, can't think of a single example where I debugged
  inference without enumerating some grid approximation on some traces of the
  model.

- Two objects, constrained to 1DoF motion, slack, expected slack, 4 params
- Projecting the model instead of 1D setting
