# Daily Context & Goals

Nishad and I are working on unit tests simultaneously, so work is proceeding
quickly. Today I'll work on the slack posterior visualizations for slack, and
creating some basic infrastructure for generating unit tests.


# Prospective Tasks

* [X] Meet with Nishad to discuss next unit tests
* [ ] Test Ben's constraint code
* [ ] Refactor unit tests with new trace constraint infrastructure
* [ ] Implement basic unit test for inference of sliding structure
