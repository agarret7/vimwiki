# Daily Context & Goals

Nishad and I are working on unit tests simultaneously, so work is proceeding
quickly. Today I'll work on the slack posterior visualizations for slack, and
creating some basic infrastructure for generating unit tests.


# Prospective Tasks

* [X] Meet with Nishad to discuss next unit tests
* [X] Test Ben's constraint code, fix infrastructure
* [ ] Refactor unit tests with new trace constraint infrastructure


# Daily Reflection

* Didn't quite finish the refactor, ran into a strange bug in my
  constraint-setting infrastructure for the unit tests.
