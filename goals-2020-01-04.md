* Mon: Collect new In-House scenes focused on simple structure changes with YCB
       objects. Aim for ~25 scenes, with reproducible process for collecting new
       scenes (so that you can add even more otherwise).  Annotation script cleanup,
       and annotating each scene. Also run annotation script on YCB-Video.
* Tues: Marginal likelihood calculation implementation, work with data to generate
        first past evaluation results
