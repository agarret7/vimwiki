# Goals

Finish data collection for the thesis.

Data should include:
* Color, depth images
* Camera intrinsics
* DOPE detections in $N/raw_detections
* Annotations (objects, structure, object-level outliers)

# Prospective Tasks

* [ ] Start up AWS instance, mount disk
* [ ] Collect test, run DOPE, visualize, verify quality
    * [ ] Build experimental stack for repeating this process quickly
* [ ] Collect first experiment
    * [ ] Run experimental stack
    * [ ] Retool annotation script to collect outliers. Add to stack.
    * [ ] Annotate first experiment
    * [ ] Write script for filtering detections based on explicit outlier
          annotations. Check quality of results.
* [ ] Collect remaining experiments, run stack.
* [ ] Collect final deliverables: zipped experiments, with detections and
      annotations, uploaded to S3. Ping Derendering chat. Plot distribution,
      over all objects and scenes, of outlier poses relative to origin. Add
      to thesis figures.
