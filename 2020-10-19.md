# Daily Context & Goals

We're proceeding with unit testing the model (visualizing and checking the
posterior). It's good to have a clear "done" condition on this.

Meeting with Vikash today to talk about unit testing.


# Prospective Tasks

* [ ] Spec out basic unit tests for inference
* [ ] Add additional unit tests design:
    * [ ] Posterior over sliding structure, sweeping over slack, w/ latents ==
          observations
    * [ ] Sequence of frames with outliers, visualizing the posterior
    * [ ] Sequence of frames going from floating -> sliding -> floating,
          visualizing 


# Daily Reflection

* TODO
