# Daily Context & Goals

We're proceeding with unit testing the model (visualizing and checking the
posterior). What would be a good "done" condition for this?

Meeting with Vikash today to talk about unit testing.


# Prospective Tasks

* [X] Talk with Nishad about next unit tests
* [X] Extend model over slack with exponential hyperprior
* [X] Implement unit test for joint density over (slack_stdev, slack_offset)


# Daily Reflection

* Good day today, unblocked myself from specifying some of the unit tests.
* Tomorrow I can work on visualizing the slack prior
